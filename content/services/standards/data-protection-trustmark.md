Organisations who volunteer to undertake DPTM accreditation make a commitment to comply with a set of robust and comprehensive criteria that demonstrate sound data protection policies and practices.

### Benefits

- Appoint and train Data Protection Officer and staff to handle personal data;
- Map processes and create systems for reasonable collection, use and disclosure of data with consent obtained and purpose made known;
- Plan and implement appropriate measures for protection, retention and disposal of data;
- Provide processes and documents to respond to customers who want to withdraw consent, and access and correction of data; and
- Map out appropriate measures to take in the event of data breach.
