### DPO as a Service

Under Personal Data Protection Act ("PDPA"), all Singapore organizations, including sole proprietors and non-profit organizations, must appoint a Data Protection Officer ("DPO"). Failing to do so is a legal offense; the financial penalties ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 based on past enforcement cases by Personal Data Protection Commission Singapore ("PDPC").

### Values

We all know that SMEs are unable to justify the hiring of a full-time DPO, either due to business and financial constraints. Appointing an unqualified person as DPO puts the company and appointed individual at high risk; any data incident or complaint raised to PDPC would lead to a regulatory issue and financial penalty.
